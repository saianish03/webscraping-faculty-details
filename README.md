# Webscraping using BeautifulSoup

Using BeautifulSoup, extracted the required details from individual faculty pages and saved these details in an xlsx file.

URL from which we scraped: https://www.mahindrauniversity.edu.in/faculty-members

The individual_page.py extracts the details from each page using it's URL.

The Main.py uses the individual_page.py to extract from all the pages.

The Excel.py is used to make an xlsx file from the data which just got scraped.
